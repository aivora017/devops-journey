## Introduction
DevOps is a set of practices that combine software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops), with the aim to shorten the systems development life cycle. It emphasizes collaboration, automation, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD).

## What is DevOps?
DevOps is primarily about improving collaboration between development and operations teams, automating operations processes, and ensuring high-quality software delivery.

### Key Principles
- **Collaboration:** Foster a culture where development and operations teams work together.
- **Automation:** Automate every part of the development and release process to reduce manual effort.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement logging and monitoring to enrich communication and improve feedback loops.
